Java Wrapper for the UN/CEFACT Cross Industry Invoice.

**This is work in progress and no release is yet available**

This library focuses currently on D16A.1 and D16B for use with the EN resulting from directive 2014/55/EU.
For D16B only the invoice is handled - all other document types are ignored at the moment.
